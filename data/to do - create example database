ISSUES
Pagination description incorrect -> "0 - 20 of 4....."
next/previous buttons should be disabled if at the first or last entry
Amount is in float/double not int as specified by client
Issue with including sidebar -> cant have a html, body etc in already open html body tags
Transaction table -> if not treasurer, should be "view" not "edit"
Should probably be a page listing all categories. And on this note, the sidebar should accomodate for the fact that the the treasurer may end up creating more categories that can be displayed on the sidebar; i.e make the sidebar go to a scrolldown after a max limit has been exceeded or have something so that maybe the treasurer can choose which categories to display?)
