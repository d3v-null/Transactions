ISSUES
Pagination description incorrect -> "0 - 20 of 4....."
next/previous buttons should be disabled if at the first or last entry
Amount is in float/double not int as specified by client
Transaction table -> if not treasurer, should be "view" not "edit"
Should probably be a page listing all categories. And on this note, the sidebar should accomodate for the fact that the the treasurer may end up creating more categories that can be displayed on the sidebar; i.e make the sidebar go to a scrolldown after a max limit has been exceeded or have something so that maybe the treasurer can choose which categories to display?)
[RESOLVED] Update for transactions still goes through even if there is an error with the form -> update should only occur if form is valid
Do we want the transaction-list table to have a fixed height so the table doesnt adjust when it has more/less content?
Make "next", "previus", etc buttons so that when clicked user is not directed back to top of page (slightly frustrating)
In creating new category 'new' button seems redundant. Also message after creating should not be 'updated' but rather 'created' -> misleading otherwise
Change or find a way to edit bootstrap css stuff -> need to be able to modify it to apply changes such as font size so that sidebar categories are displayed properly without overflowing oddly
